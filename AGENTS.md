# Docs & Agent Guide (Short)

- Keep the project root lean: only `README.md` and this short `AGENTS.md`. All other documentation lives under `docs/`.
- Use `docs/AGENTS.md` for the full documentation playbook, templates, and examples.
- Follow the “now & next” rule: living docs capture current state and near-term work; deep history lives in GitHub issues/PRs and git history.
- When adding docs, place them in the right subfolder (`docs/decisions`, `docs/spec`, `docs/status`, `docs/runbooks`, `docs/roadmaps`, `docs/archive`, `docs/templates`).
- Link to GitHub issues/PRs for detailed context instead of duplicating history in-repo.
