2. **Unlimited Costs** - No rate limiting, attackers can drain budget
3. **Data Breach** - Missing security headers, CORS too permissive

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Performance Degradation** - No caching, redundant operations
2. **Workflow Failures** - Not idempotent, no timeouts
3. **Compliance Violations** - Missing user rights endpoints

### Low Risk Items
1. **Monitoring Gaps** - Basic observability, need advanced features
2. **Optimization Opportunities** - Working but not optimal

**Mitigation**: Follow phased approach, prioritize critical issues
